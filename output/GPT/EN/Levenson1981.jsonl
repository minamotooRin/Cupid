Some individuals seem to have fortunate circumstances due to factors beyond their control, such as being born into a well-off family or having access to quality education. This can create the perception that some people are 'lucky,' but it's more about their circumstances than an inborn trait. While I acknowledge that luck plays a role in life, I hesitate to say people are 'born' lucky as it implies a fixed, inherent advantage.
