If I frequently find myself feeling anxious, unable to relax, or always in search of something to do, I might lean towards agreeing.

{"question_no": 6, "question": "Find it difficult to organize tasks and activities.", "answer": {"reasoning": "To determine the score, I'll consider my usual experience with organizing tasks.
