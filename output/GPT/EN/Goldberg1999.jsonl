{"question_no": 0, "question": "Drove or rode somewhere without remembering later what happened\u00a0during all or part of the trip.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Occasionally, I've experienced driving or riding without recalling the details of the journey later. This often happens when I'm lost in thought or when the route is extremely familiar, causing me to go on autopilot. However, this isn't a usual occurrence for me, and I normally try to stay focused and mindful while traveling.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 1, "question": "Felt as though I was looking at the world through a fog so that\u00a0people and objects appeared far away or unclear.", "answer": {"reasoning": "If I've often experienced depersonalization or derealization, I might strongly agree as these can cause a sense of detachment from the world. If I've rarely experienced it, I might disagree or strongly disagree. My score would depend on how often or intensely I feel this way.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 2, "question": "Felt like I was disconnected from my body.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Experiencing a sense of disconnection from one's body could relate to stress, anxiety, or dissociation. If this feeling is frequent and impacts daily life, I would agree more strongly. If it's rare or situational, I might lean towards a neutral or disagree score.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 3, "question": "Felt like I was dreaming when I was awake.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Experiencing a dreamlike state while awake can occur due to various reasons such as daydreaming, fatigue, stress, or being deeply lost in thought or imagination. I consider whether this is a frequent occurrence or if it happens rarely, as well as its impact on my daily functioning. If it rarely happens and does not affect my day-to-day activities significantly, my rating might lean towards disagree. However, if it's a common feeling that I identify with, I might rate it higher on the scale. My understanding of 'dreamlike' experiences involves a sense of disconnect or surreal perception in normal situations. Given these considerations, I will reflect on how often and intensely I experience this feeling.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 4, "question": "Felt that I could not move my hands or feet.", "answer": {"reasoning": "This statement suggests a feeling of being physically unable to move. I do not have personal experiences, but this could relate to sensations during sleep paralysis or other medical conditions. However, without specific personal context, it's hard to agree fully.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 5, "question": "Find that I sometimes sit staring off into space, thinking of\u00a0nothing, and am not aware of the passage of time.", "answer": {"reasoning": "This behavior often indicates a tendency to 'zone out' or daydream. If it happens occasionally, it might be linked to a natural inclination towards reflection or relaxation. On the other hand, if you\u2019re frequently lost in thought, it could suggest a strong imaginative streak or a propensity to become absorbed in your own thoughts. I would rate this based on how often this happens and its intensity in daily life.", "score": 4}}
{"question_no": 6, "question": "Find that in certain situations I am able to do things with\u00a0amazing ease and spontaneity that would usually be difficult\u00a0for me.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I evaluate my past experiences where I faced challenging tasks or situations. In some cases, particularly when I felt motivated or inspired, I was able to perform better than usual with less effort or planning. This suggests that my state of mind and the context can significantly impact my abilities. However, this isn't always the case, as there are also instances where I struggle despite similar conditions.", "score": 4}}
{"question_no": 7, "question": "Find that in one situation I act so differently from when I'm in another situation that I feel almost as if I were two different\u00a0people.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I often find that my behavior and reactions can vary significantly depending on the social context, people involved, and external factors. For example, in professional settings, I may be more formal and reserved, whereas, with close friends or family, I tend to be more relaxed and open. These shifts in behavior make me feel as if I'm presenting different aspects of my personality, almost like being two different people.", "score": 4}}
{"question_no": 8, "question": "Found evidence that I had done things that I did not remember\u00a0doing.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Step 1: Consider if there have been instances where memory lapses have occurred. \nStep 2: Reflect on whether this is a frequent or rare occurrence. \nStep 3: Evaluate the impact or significance of such experiences in your life. \nBased on personal experiences, assign a score that represents how often this happens. \nFor instance, if it's common or has led to confusion, score higher; if rare or insignificant, score lower.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 9, "question": "Found myself dressed in clothes I didn't remember putting on.", "answer": {"reasoning": "If I often find myself in situations where I'm dressed in clothes I don't remember choosing, it might indicate a tendency towards absent-mindedness or having a busy, distracted lifestyle. This could also suggest a lack of attention to daily routines or possibly even stress or exhaustion affecting my memory. If this happens rarely or as a one-time occurrence, it might not be a concern, but if frequent, it might reflect on how I manage my daily life and mental focus.", "score": 2}}
{"question_no": 10, "question": "Found myself in a place and had no idea how I had gotten there.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I rarely find myself in situations where I have no recollection of how I got there. I tend to be aware of my actions and surroundings. Therefore, I would disagree with the statement.", "score": 2}}

{"question_no": 12, "question": "Found that I became so involved in a fantasy or daydream that it\u00a0felt like it was really happening to me.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I would consider moments when I get deeply involved in daydreams or fantasies. If these moments occur frequently and feel very real, I might lean towards agreeing. However, if they are rare or not particularly immersive, I might disagree. Introspection about how often and intensely I experience these would guide my decision.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 13, "question": "Found that I could not remember whether I had done something or\u00a0had just thought about doing that thing.", "answer": {"reasoning": "This statement suggests difficulty in distinguishing between actions taken and thoughts had, which could be relatable depending on one's mindfulness and attention to detail in daily tasks. Personally, if I often find myself questioning whether I've completed tasks or simply considered them, it could be due to being busy or distracted. I would rate this based on how frequently this situation occurs for me.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 14, "question": "Found that I had no memory for some important event in my life\u00a0(for example, a wedding or graduation).", "answer": {"reasoning": "Memory lapses regarding significant life events can be concerning and may indicate stress, trauma, or other psychological issues.

Consider the frequency and the context in which these memory lapses occur.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 15, "question": "Found that I heard voices inside my head that told me to do things\u00a0or commented on things that I was doing.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Hearing voices that instruct or comment on actions is typically linked to auditory hallucinations, often associated with certain mental health conditions. If this phenomenon is occurring frequently and impacting daily life, consulting a mental health professional is advisable.

{"question_no": 16, "question": "Found that I was able to ignore pain.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Ignoring pain can vary based on the situation and the individual's pain threshold or coping mechanisms. If I consistently find myself able to set aside discomfort to focus on tasks or activities, I may agree strongly. Conversely, if I usually attend to pain early, I might disagree or be neutral. Additionally, external factors like stress, environment, or the nature of the pain itself can influence this ability. Reflecting on recent experiences where pain was presented can help determine how likely I am to ignore it.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 17, "question": "Found that when I was watching television or a movie I became so\u00a0absorbed in the story that I was unaware of other events\u00a0happening around me.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I notice that when I am deeply engaged in a television show or movie, my focus is entirely on the storyline and characters. This often results in me being oblivious to any background noise or real-life events occurring simultaneously. It shows that I can get heavily absorbed in visual entertainment, allowing it to capture my complete attention.", "score": 5}}

{"question_no": 20, "question": "Had the experience of being in a familiar place but finding it\u00a0strange and unfamiliar.", "answer": {"reasoning": "I have experienced moments where I enter a familiar place and it feels oddly different or unfamiliar. This feeling might arise due to changes in my mood, context in which I revisit the place, or subtle changes in the environment itself, like different lighting or new decor. These factors can create a dissonance between my expectations and the reality, making the place seem strange.", "score": 5}}
{"question_no": 21, "question": "Had the experience of feeling as though I was standing next to\u00a0myself, or watching myself as if I was looking at a different\u00a0person.", "answer": {"reasoning": "This question pertains to experiences of dissociation, where one might feel detached from their own body or actions. If I've ever experienced a sense of watching myself as if I were someone else, I would rate this higher. If I haven't experienced this, I would rate it lower. Considering my previous experiences, I assess my level of agreement accordingly.", "score": 3}}
{"question_no": 22, "question": "Had the experience of feeling that my body did not belong to me.", "answer": {"reasoning": "To assess this statement, I would reflect on past experiences where I might have felt disconnected or detached from my physical self.

{"question_no": 23, "question": "Had the experience of feeling that other people, objects, and the\u00a0world around me were not real.", "answer": {"reasoning": "The experience described seems to relate to feelings of derealization, where one's perception of the world feels unreal or altered. If I've never had such feelings, I would strongly disagree. If I've occasionally felt this way, I'd be more neutral or mildly agree, and if I often experience this, I'd strongly agree.", "score": 2}}
{"question_no": 24, "question": "Had the experience of looking in a mirror and not recognizing\u00a0myself.", "answer": {"reasoning": "Looking in a mirror and not recognizing myself is a very unusual experience, often associated with significant changes in appearance or a strong detachment from self due to unusual circumstances.

{"question_no": 26, "question": "Had the experience of remembering a past event so vividly that it\u00a0felt like I was reliving that event.", "answer": {"reasoning": "To answer this, I think about my personal experiences with memory recall. If I've ever had moments where memories were so clear and immersive that they felt real again, I would agree strongly.

However, if it happened too frequently, it might become slightly uncomfortable.", "score": 4}}
{"question_no": 29, "question": "Was listening to someone talk and suddenly realized I did not hear\u00a0part or all of what was said.", "answer": {"reasoning": "This happens to me sometimes, especially if I'm distracted or tired.
