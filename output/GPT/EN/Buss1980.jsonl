{"question_no": 1, "question": "Am easily intimidated.", "answer": {"reasoning": "To determine how easily I feel intimidated, I reflect on past situations where I've faced authority figures, challenging environments, or confrontational situations. If I often find myself feeling anxious or hesitant in these contexts, it indicates a higher level of intimidation. Conversely, if I'm generally confident and unfazed, the score would be lower. Additionally, I consider how my response to intimidation affects my behavior and decisions. Personal and professional experiences, feedback from others, and emotional self-awareness all contribute to this self-assessment.", "score": 3}}
