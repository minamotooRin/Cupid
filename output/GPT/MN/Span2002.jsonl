If I find myself struggling to sit still, tapping my foot, or frequently adjusting my position during meetings or quiet times, these are signs of being fidgety. I also consider situations where I might feel anxious or uncomfortable, as these can contribute to fidgety behavior. Reflecting on these observations helps me decide where I fall on the scale.
